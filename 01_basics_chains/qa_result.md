## Question
Explain LangChain chains like I'm 5, in a tiny story with one example.

## Answer
Okay, imagine you're building a robot that can answer questions! LangChain "chains" are like building blocks for your robot. Each block does a little job, like finding information or writing a sentence, and we connect them together to make the robot do bigger tasks. For example, one chain might first *search* the internet for facts about cats, then *write* a short story using those facts!
