# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Demo Results

**Time:** 2025-09-28 21:45:24  
**Model:** gemma3:12b-it-qat  
**Vector Store:** FAISS  
**Retrieval:** Top 3 similar documents

## RAG Process

1. **Query**: User asks a question
2. **Retrieve**: Find most relevant documents using embeddings
3. **Augment**: Add retrieved context to the prompt
4. **Generate**: LLM answers using the context

## Results

### Query 1: "What is LangChain and what does it provide?"

**RAG Response:**
LangChain helps maintain conversation context across multiple interactions. It offers different memory types like Buffer, Window, and Summary. (memory_guide)


---

### Query 2: "How can I run language models locally?"

**RAG Response:**
The provided context doesn't contain information about running language models locally.


---

### Query 3: "What is RAG and how does it work?"

**RAG Response:**
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines document retrieval with language model generation to provide grounded answers. It retrieves relevant documents and uses them as context for the LLM (rag_explanation).


---

### Query 4: "Tell me about different types of memory in LangChain"

**RAG Response:**
The provided context does not discuss different types of memory in LangChain.


---

### Query 5: "What are embeddings and why are they useful?"

**RAG Response:**
Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors where similar texts have similar vector representations. They enable semantic search and similarity matching (embeddings_guide).


---

### Query 6: "How do agents work and what is the ReAct pattern?"

**RAG Response:**
The provided context does not contain information about how agents work or the ReAct pattern.


---

### Query 7: "What are the benefits of using prompt templates?"

**RAG Response:**
Prompt templates allow you to create reusable prompts with variables and support few-shot learning and structured output generation (prompts_guide).

## Key Benefits of RAG

- **Grounded Answers**: Responses are based on retrieved documents
- **Up-to-date Information**: Can use recent documents as context
- **Source Attribution**: Can cite where information comes from
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Less likely to make up facts

## Production Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Answer questions using knowledge base
- **Document Q&A**: Ask questions about specific documents
- **Research Assistant**: Find and summarize relevant information
- **Code Documentation**: Answer questions about codebases
